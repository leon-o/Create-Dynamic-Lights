## 1.0.0 Initial release
1. Dynamic Lighting for Contraptions:
   - Automatically generate light blocks[^1] when Contraptions move. When Contraptions move, light blocks are dynamically placed and removed.
2. Integration with LambDynamicLights:
   - Create and update light sources for LambDynamicLights mod in real-time as Contraptions move, allowing for smoother and more immersive lighting transitions.

[^1]Light Block: A Light Block in Minecraft is a special block that emits light. It is invisible and intangible, 
meaning it doesn't obstruct movement or building, and is typically used to provide lighting in areas 
where visible light sources like torches or lamps are not desired. 
The difference between a Light Block and Dynamic Light created by mods like LambDynamicLights is that 
Light Blocks are actual blocks in the game world and can affect the environment, such as melting ice or snow, 
preventing mob spawning, etc.
